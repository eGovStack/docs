## Integration <a id="Integration"></a>

### Integration Scope <a id="Integration-Scope"></a>

The trade-license service is currently used to issue trade licenses, perform stakeholder registration and issue lockdown pass.

### Integration Benefits <a id="Integration-Benefits"></a>

* Provide backend support for the different license registration process.
* Mseva and SMS notifications on application status changes.
* The elastic search index for creating visualizations and Dashboards.
* Bpa Stakeholder registration provides new roles to the user to access the Building Plan Approval system.
* Supports workflow which is configurable

### Steps to Integration <a id="Steps-to-Integration"></a>

1. To integrate, host of tl-services service should be overwritten in the helm chart.
2. {servicename}/\_create/ \_create should be added as the create endpoint for creating any license in the system
3. {servicename}/\_search/ \_search should be added as the search endpoint. This method handles all requests to search existing records depending on different search criteria
4. {servicename}/\_update/ \_update should be added as the update endpoint. This method is used to update fields in existing records or to update the status of the application based on workflow.
