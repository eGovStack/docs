# Trade License Fee

## Introduction <a id="introduction"></a>

Once the Trade Ontology is defined, the next step is to allocate the license fee associated with the Trades.

Dependent on the Trade Classification Level \([Types](trade-type.md)/ [Subtypes](trade-sub-type.md)\), the fee allocated might be the same across the Sate or could vary from ULB to ULB. There could be a distinct fee\(s\) for two different types of applications \(new and renewal\).

Following are the key tasks to be executed :

* Allocate the License Fee according to Trade Classification Level \(Types/Subtypes\).
* Map the License fee with respective Trade Classification Level.

## Data Table <a id="data-table"></a>
