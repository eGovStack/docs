  Quickstart Infra is recommended to jump start with minimal default DIGIT
  services to get a sense of the various installation steps and system
  requirements.

# 1. Infra Local Setup (k3d)

## **Setting up a Kubernetes cluster on a Local machine/VM**

In your machine, ensure that the docker is installed and running, then Run the following in terminal/command prompt. As part of prerequisites, you have already installed the k3d. If not please go back install using this [instructions](../quickstart.md#requirements)&#x20;

Let's setup the lightweight kubernetes cluster on your machine.

1. First, Create "/Kube" directory in any desired place (ensure you use the right dir path, if it is different from the example) and change permission. This will be used as k3d cluster persistent storage to store metadata and container logs .&#x20;
   1.  ```
       cd ~
       sudo mkdir kube
       sudo chmod 777 kube
       cd kube
       pwd  #copy the path you get here. Provide the absolute path the below 
             command, just replace /kube with your directory path

       ```


2.  Create a k3d cluster with a single master node and 2 agents (Worker Nodes) and mount the above created directory (for data persistence). Here's where it stores all the metadata and persists the logs of the workloads.

    1. `k3d cluster create --k3s-server-arg "--no-deploy=traefik" --agents 2 -v "/home/<user_name>/kube:/kube@agent[0,1]" -v "/home/<user_name>/kube:/kube@server[0]" --port "80:80@loadbalancer"`

    **\*NOTE:** Update "/home/\<user\_name>/kube" this path in above cmd with your respective absolute path.&#x20;
3. When cluster creation is successful, Get the kubeconfig file, which will allow you to connect the to the cluster.
   1. `k3d kubeconfig get k3s-default > myk3dconfig`
   2. `kubectl config use-context k3d-k3s-default --kubeconfig=myk3dconfig`
4. Verify the Cluster creation by running the following commands from your local machine where the kubectl is installed. It gives you the sample output as below if everything works fine.
   1.  `kubectl cluster-info`

       `OutPut`

       ```
       Kubernetes control plane is running at https://0.0.0.0:33931
       CoreDNS is running at https://0.0.0.0:33931/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy
       Metrics-server is running at https://0.0.0.0:33931/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/https:metrics-server:/proxy
       ```


   2.  `k3d cluster list`

       `OutPut:`

       ```
       NAME          SERVERS   AGENTS   LOADBALANCER
       k3s-default   1/1       2/2      true
       ```


   3.  `kubectl get nodes`

       `OutPut:`

       ```
       NAME                       STATUS   ROLES                  AGE     VERSION
       k3d-k3s-default-agent-0    Ready    <none>                 3d18h   v1.21.1+k3s1
       k3d-k3s-default-agent-1    Ready    <none>                 3d18h   v1.21.1+k3s1
       k3d-k3s-default-server-0   Ready    control-plane,master   3d18h   v1.21.1+k3s1
       ```


   4.  `kubectl top nodes`

       `OutPut:`

       ```
       W0625 07:56:24.588781   12810 top_node.go:119] Using json format to get metrics. Next release will switch to protocol-buffers, switch early by passing --use-protocol-buffers flag
       NAME                       CPU(cores)   CPU%   MEMORY(bytes)   MEMORY%   
       k3d-k3s-default-agent-0    547m         6%     1505Mi          9%        
       k3d-k3s-default-agent-1    40m          0%     2175Mi          13%       
       k3d-k3s-default-server-0   59m          0%     2286Mi          14%  
       ```



If the above steps are completed successfully, your Cluster is now up and running ready to proceed with the DIGIT Deployment.
