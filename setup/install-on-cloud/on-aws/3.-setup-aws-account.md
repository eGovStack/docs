Before you proceed with the DIGIT Deployment on AWS

## Prerequisites

* [**Install AWS CLI**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html) on your local machine so that you can use aws cli commands to provision and manage the cloud resources on your account.
* Install [**AWS IAM Authenticator**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/install-aws-iam-authenticator.html) that helps you authenticate your connection from your local machine so that you should be able to deploy DIGIT services.

* You need to singup for the AWS account if you do not already have one. Use this link to [get started](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/)

<!---->

*   Use the [**AWS IAM User**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id\_users\_create.html) **credentials provided** for the Terraform ([**Infra-as-code**](https://devops.digit.org/devops-general/infra-as-code)) to connect with your AWS account and provision the cloud resources.

    1. You'll get a **Secret Access Key** and **Access Key ID**. **Save them safely.**
    2. Open the terminal and Run the following command you have already installed the AWS CLI and you have the credentials saved. (Provide the credentials and you can leave the region and output format as blank)

    ```
    aws configure --profile egov-workshop-account 

    AWS Access Key ID []:<Your access key>
    AWS Secret Access Key []:<Your secret key>
    Default region name []: ap-south-1
    Default output format []: text
    ```

    1. The above will create the following file In your machine as /Users/\<your username>/.aws/credentials

    ```
    [egov-test-account] 
    aws_access_key_id=*********** 
    aws_secret_access_key=****************************
    ```
