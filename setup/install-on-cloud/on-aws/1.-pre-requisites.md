# 1. Pre-requisites

The [**Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/what-is-eks.html) is one of the AWS services for deploying, managing and scaling any distributed and containerized workloads, here we can provision the EKS cluster on AWS from the ground up using [**terraform**](https://www.terraform.io/intro/index.html) **(**infra-as-code) and then deploy the DIGIT platform services as config-as-code using [**Helm**](https://helm.sh/docs/).

## Pre-read:

* Know about EKS: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsUnPWp5ilc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsUnPWp5ilc)
* Know what is terraform: [https://youtu.be/h970ZBgKINg](https://youtu.be/h970ZBgKINg)

## Prerequisites <a href="#prerequisites" id="prerequisites"></a>

1. [**AWS account**](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup?nc2=h\_ct\&src=default\&redirect\_url=https%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fregistration-confirmation#/start) with the admin access to provision EKS Service, you can always subscribe to free AWS account to learn the basics and try, but there is a limit to [**what is offered as free**](https://aws.amazon.com/free/), for this demo you need to have a commercial subscription to the EKS service, if you want to try out for a day or two, it might cost you about Rs 500 - 1000.&#x20;
   1. **Note**: Post the Demo, for the eGov internal folks, you can request for the AWS access for 4 hrs time bound access to eGov's training AWS account upon on the request and available number of slots per day)
2. Install [**kubectl**](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) on your local machine that helps you interact with the kubernetes cluster
3. Install [**Helm**](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) that helps you package the services along with the configurations, envs, secrets, etc into a [**kubernetes manifests**](https://devspace.cloud/docs/cli/deployment/kubernetes-manifests/what-are-manifests)
4. Install [**terraform**](https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/0.14.10/) version (0.14.10) for the Infra-as-code (IaC) to provision cloud resources as code and with desired resource graph and also it helps to destroy the cluster at one go.
   1. If you already have a different version of the terraform version running install [tfswitch](https://github.com/warrensbox/terraform-switcher) that would allow you to have multiple terraform version in the same machine and toggle between the desired versions.
5. \*\*\*\*[**Install AWS CLI**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html) \*\*\*\*on your local machine so that you can use aws cli commands to provision and manage the cloud resources on your account.
6. Install [**AWS IAM Authenticator**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/install-aws-iam-authenticator.html) that helps you authenticate your connection from your local machine so that you should be able to deploy DIGIT services.
7.  Use the [**AWS IAM User**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id\_users\_create.html) **credentials provided** for the Terraform ([**Infra-as-code**](https://devops.digit.org/devops-general/infra-as-code)) to connect with your AWS account and provision the cloud resources.

    1. You'll get a **Secret Access Key** and **Access Key ID**. **Save them safely.**
    2. Open the terminal and Run the following command you have already installed the AWS CLI and you have the credentials saved. (Provide the credentials and you can leave the region and output format as blank)

    ```
    aws configure --profile egov-workshop-account 

    AWS Access Key ID []:<Your access key>
    AWS Secret Access Key []:<Your secret key>
    Default region name []: ap-south-1
    Default output format []: text
    ```

    1. The above will create the following file In your machine as /Users/\<your username>/.aws/credentials

    ```
    [egov-test-account] 
    aws_access_key_id=*********** 
    aws_secret_access_key=****************************
    ```
