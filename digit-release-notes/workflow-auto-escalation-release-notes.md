## Release Highlights

* Configure SLA at a workflow state level
* Escalate the application to a role if there is a breach in SLA
* Make the application status as deemed approved or reject on breach of an SLA
* Escalate the application to the next logical step in the workflow ladder if there is a breach in SLA
