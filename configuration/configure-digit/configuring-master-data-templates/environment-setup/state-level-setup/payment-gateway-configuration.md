# Payment Gateway Configuration

### Introduction

DIGIT has modules which require the user to pay for the service that he/ she is availing for example property tax, trade license etc. . In order to achieve the functionality, we have a common payment gateway developed which acts a liaison between DIGIT apps and external payment gateways \(which depends on the client requirements\).

This module facilitates payments and lookup of transaction status.

### Data Table

Following are the details required from the payment gateway vendor in order to configure the payment gateway:

| Sr. No | Integration Kit | API Documentation | Redirect Working Key | Merchant Id  | Test credential of Debit Card/ Net banking |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. | File Name | File Name | XYZ\#123 | UDDUK | File Name |
