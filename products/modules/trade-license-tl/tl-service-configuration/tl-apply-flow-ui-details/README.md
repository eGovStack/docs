## **Apply for Trade License**

Users can apply for trade license application by clicking on the Apply for Trade License button. Users can add all the information as per the questions asked across the workflow.

The application for trade license is created for the current financial year.

**Apply Flow** - The trade license registration screen is displayed after login that helps users identify    the documents required to apply for a trade license. A citizen info card at the bottom of the page displays any additional information about the maximum size of the file that can be uploaded.

**Trade License Details/Assessment Flow -** This flow captures the trade specific information required for registering the trade.&#x20;

Trade Name - The user provides the name of the trade. An info card is displayed at the bottom of the screen stating that the license will be issued for the current financial year. The financial year value is retrieved from the MDMS.

Trade Units - Users must provide the trade category as either goods or services. Based on the selected option the Trade Type is loaded from the MDMS as a drop-down list. The trade sub-type options are loaded based on the selected trade type. The unit of measure and UOM value gets pre-populated from the MDMS as per the options selected above.

Users must enter at least one unit to move forward. Clicking on Add More Unit option enables users to enter additional units. Clicking on the delete icon on the top right corner of the unit card removes the unit.

Accessories - The Accessory page inquires if there are any accessories required for the business. Accessories may not be compulsory for all trades. If yes, it will move to the accessory details page. If no, it will skip it altogether and will load the address flow.

Accessory details - The options for accessories is retrieved from the MDMS. The Unit of Measure or UOM is pre-populated and cannot be edited. The users can edit the UOM value and the accessory count. In some cases these are pre-populated from the MDMS. Clicking on Add More Trade Accessory button allows users to add multiple accessories.

**Common PT integration with TL:** After entering the trade details, users have the option to either search and integrate the already created property or create a new lightweight property data for the trade license. This step can be skipped and users can proceed with the normal address details flow.

Once property is selected user can see the details of the property on the property details page. Refer to the [Common PT ](../../../property-tax/property-tax-service/common-pt.md)document for more details.

Users can add multiple owners by clicking on the add owner button - a similar functionality as in trade units and accessories. The Add Owner button is not visible in case the user selects a single owner on the previous page.

## **Technical Implementation Details**

All screens are developed using the new-UI structure followed previously in FSM, PGR and PT, except for multi-component.

Apply Trade License Main Index link: [https://github.com/egovernments/digit-ui-internals/blob/main/packages/modules/tl/src/pages/citizen/Create/index.js](https://github.com/egovernments/digit-ui-internals/blob/main/packages/modules/tl/src/pages/citizen/Create/index.js)

The TL (Trade License) module is segregated into a specified structure. The screen configuration is inside the PageComponent folder, and the configuration for routing of the pages are mentioned under the config folder which is common for both citizen and employees. Below is the snippet for folder structure and routing configuration.

![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (265) (1).png>)

```
export const newConfig = [
  {
    head: "",
    body: [
      {
        type: "component",
        component: "TLInfoLabel",
        key: "tradedetils1",
        withoutLabel: true,
        hideInCitizen: true,
      }
    ]
  },
```

Pages Folder is where the high-level configuration for controlling the whole flow is mentioned, for citizens and employees. Citizen flows include Create, Edit Trade, Renewal, Applications and Search Trade. The index or the starting point of the entire flow is available in this folder.

In the Accessory-details page, the Billing slab search API `"/tl-calculator/billingslab/_search"` is called. This returns the array list of all the accessories for which the billing slab has been configured. If the response returns an empty array then the options are curated from the MDMS API mentioned in the MDMS data section.

After completing the flow the user can download the acknowledgement PDF form of the License created.  PDF generation config link: [https://github.com/egovernments/digit-ui-internals/blob/main/packages/modules/tl/src/utils/getTLAcknowledgementData.js](https://github.com/egovernments/digit-ui-internals/blob/main/packages/modules/tl/src/utils/getTLAcknowledgementData.js)

The Utils folder basically contains all the methods used throughout the TL module. Additional common methods can be imported and added to this folder.&#x20;

For creating an application the Create API from Trade License is called using the React hooks. This is declared in the hooks/elements/TL as TLService.

## **MDMS Data**

There are multiple pages within the workflows where data is imported from the MDMS. The table below lists the pages .js files for distinct page components.

| PageComponent            | MDMS Detail                                                    | Module Details Name | Master-Detail Name    |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------- |
| TradeLicense             | List of documents required for registration                    | `TradeLicense`      | `Documents`           |
| SelectTradeName          | Current Financial Year                                         | `egf-master`        | `FinancialYear`       |
| SelectVehicleType        | Type of mobility trade                                         | `common-masters`    | `StructureType`       |
| SelectBuildingType       | Type of Steady Trade                                           | `common-masters`    | `StructureType`       |
| SelectTradeUnits         | List of trade category and its corresponding type and sub-type | `TradeLicense`      | `TradeType`           |
| SelectAccessoriesDetails | Lit of Accessory and its Unit of measure and UOM value         | `TradeLicense`      | `AccessoriesCategory` |
| TLSelectAddress          | List of cities and its corresponding localities                | `TradeLicense`      | `tenants`             |
| SelectOwnerShipDetails   | categories imported are single and multiple owner.             | `common-masters`    | `OwnerShipCategory`   |
| SelectOwnerDetails       | List of Gender options.                                        | `common-masters`    | `GenderType`          |

React Hooks are used to call MDMS data that is shared across the modules. Below is the code snippet for the MDMS call.

```
const { isLoading, data: Documentsob = {} } = Digit.Hooks.tl.useTradeLicenseMDMS(stateId, "TradeLicense", "TLDocuments");
```

## **Localization**

Localization keys are added to the ‘_rainmaker-tl_’ locale module. In future, if any new labels are implemented in the Trade License (Citizen) it is pushed to the locale DB in the _rainmaker-tl_ locale module. Below is an example of few locale labels.

![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (158).png>)
